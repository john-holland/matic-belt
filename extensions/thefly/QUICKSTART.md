# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Installation & Setup

```bash
cd /Users/johnholland/Developers/Bat_Belt/extensions/thefly

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Start the integrated demo
./start-integrated.sh
```

## Access the Demos

Once the server is running, open your browser to:

### 🏠 Main Landing Page
**http://localhost:3000**

Choose your experience from the main menu.

### 🌌 Galaxy Consciousness Topology
**http://localhost:3000/galaxy**

**What to do:**
1. Click "Start Simulation"
2. Watch galaxies evolve consciousness
3. Click "Boost Milky Way" or "Boost Sagittarius A*" to inject consciousness
4. Wait for "Third Space" to emerge (look for magenta sphere)
5. Observe topological relationships and bridge points

**What you're seeing:**
- Small glowing orbs = Galaxies
- Cyan lines = Information flow between galaxies
- Yellow dots = Bridge points (wormholes in consciousness space)
- Magenta sphere = Third space (emergent consciousness)
- Concentric rings = Resonance patterns

### 🎨 Audio Swizzle Visualizer
**http://localhost:3000/audio-swizzle**

**What to do:**
1. Click "Enable Microphone" (allow browser permission)
2. Click "Start 2D" or "Start 3D"
3. Make sounds! Talk, sing, play music
4. Or click test tones: A4, A5, or White Noise
5. Watch how different sounds create different patterns

**What you're seeing:**
- **Height**: Pitch (higher sounds at top)
- **Width**: Harmonic richness (richer sounds to the right)
- **Color**: Red/Orange = Bass, Blue/Purple = Treble
- **Brightness**: Volume (louder = brighter)
- **Size**: Harmonic complexity (more harmonics = bigger)
- **Shape**: 
  - Circle = Simple tone
  - Star = Rich harmonics
  - Spike = Noise/percussion
  - Wave = Complex waveform

### 🔮 Integrated Experience
**http://localhost:3000/integrated**

**What to do:**
1. Click "Enable Mic" in the control panel
2. Click "Start Galaxy" to begin consciousness simulation
3. Click "Start Audio" to begin sound visualization
4. Make sounds or play test tones
5. Watch how sound influences galaxy consciousness
6. Watch for "Third Space" emergence
7. Observe "SYNCHRONIZED" status when systems resonate

**What you're seeing:**
- Left panel = Galaxy consciousness topology
- Right panel = Audio visualization
- Bottom panel = Controls and metrics
- Audio energy influences galaxy consciousness
- Galaxy consciousness affects audio visualization colors
- "Resonance" bar shows audio-galaxy synchronization

## Quick Experiments

### Experiment 1: Third Space Emergence
1. Start galaxy simulation
2. Repeatedly boost both galaxies
3. Wait for third space to emerge
4. Observe annealing progress

### Experiment 2: Sound Shapes
1. Start audio visualizer
2. Play A4 tone → See circle at middle height
3. Play A5 tone → See circle higher up (double frequency)
4. Play white noise → See many spikes everywhere
5. Hum or sing → See complex moving patterns

### Experiment 3: Audio-Galaxy Resonance
1. Start integrated view with both systems
2. Play low bass tones → Watch Sagittarius A* consciousness increase
3. Play high treble sounds → Watch Milky Way consciousness increase
4. Wait for third space emergence
5. Notice how audio colors shift with cosmic consciousness

### Experiment 4: Multi-Source Separation
1. Start audio visualizer
2. Enable microphone
3. Play music in background while talking
4. Observe different visual elements for different sound sources
5. Notice spatial separation and color coding

## Troubleshooting

**"Enable Microphone" doesn't work**
- Allow browser permission when prompted
- Must use HTTPS or localhost
- Try Chrome or Firefox

**Nothing appears in visualizations**
- Make sure you clicked "Start"
- For audio: Make sure microphone is enabled or play a test tone
- For galaxy: Wait a few seconds for simulation to begin

**Third space never emerges**
- Boost galaxies multiple times
- Play loud audio (integrated mode)
- Wait longer (can take 100+ simulation ticks)
- Try adding more galaxies

**Performance is slow**
- Close other browser tabs
- Use 2D mode instead of 3D for audio
- Reduce number of galaxies in galaxy sim

## Understanding the Concepts

### Galaxy Consciousness
- Each galaxy has a "consciousness level" (0-1)
- Consciousness increases through:
  - Self-simulation depth
  - Information density
  - Resonance with other galaxies
  - External influence (your input!)

### Third Space
- Emerges when two conscious systems interact deeply
- Represents new consciousness from the interaction itself
- "Annealing" = stabilizing to coherent state
- Creates resonance patterns (harmonic frequencies)

### Audio Swizzle
- Multi-dimensional mapping of sound to visuals
- Designed for accessibility (deaf users can "see" sound)
- Also reveals hidden patterns in audio
- Each dimension maps to different acoustic property

### Integrated System
- Audio influences galaxy (high energy → more consciousness)
- Galaxy influences audio (cosmic patterns → color shifts)
- System detects resonance/synchronization
- Demonstrates bidirectional relationship

## Next Steps

1. **Explore each system individually** to understand them
2. **Try the integrated view** to see cross-system effects
3. **Experiment with different sounds** and galaxy configurations
4. **Read README-INTEGRATED.md** for deep conceptual dive
5. **Modify the code** to create your own mappings!

## Example Session

```
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Launch Integrated Experience"
3. In control panel:
   - Click "Enable Mic"
   - Click "Start Galaxy"
   - Click "Start Audio"
4. Boost Milky Way a few times
5. Play an A4 test tone
